          One day I was updating my computer programs and the MacOS software lagged. I restarted the computer and it would stop loading on the same bar. I knew the computer was almost out of memory space so I suspected it could be a fatal lag. Therefore, I reinstalled the whole computer software.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time in 3 years I had computer full of memory space. This was something to celebrate and since I was at my cousin’s place who just bought a new computer, we wanted to play a multi-player computer game. I suggested Civilisation IV, which is a strategy game based on building and developing civilisations that correlate with the real world history. I searched on web for the newest version called Civilisation IV: Gathering Storm. After a few hours of downloading, I installed it on my computer, then on my cousins computer. We turned it on and watched the introduction of the video. It starts with a group of scientists standing on ice glacier possibly in Antarctic or Arctic, and the narrator's voice speaks Human advancement knows no boundary… Then suddenly a glacier collapses, the ice cracks beneath the scientists feet, opens and they dramatically fall inside as the voice speaks …but this has been without its price. The video is about the different aspects of civilisations and the milestones in human history. This video captured my attention because it presented climate change as a natural part of human evolution. It states that it’s no longer a debate weather human activity is causing global warming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is designed around civilisations of our real world. It’s depicting the progress of human civilisations: increasing capacities, complexities and modernities. To start, you choose one of the civilisations. It includes many extinct pre-historic civilisations like Aztecs, Mapuche, Zulu, that have different characteristics than the modern ones like Polish, American, Australian. All civilisations start in pre-historic era and progress to industrialisation and modernisation. As we approached industrialisation in early 19th century, the window for global warming meter lights up. It informs that by using more oil, gas, all sorts of energies to power up your civilisation, you increase CO2 emissions. That increases the frequency of storms, tornadoes and floods, that cause civilisations to lose land on which you grow food, build cities, industries, get your precious and luxury resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          We both noticed the global warming meter but the game is designed for you to have too many other things to worry about: spreading of religions, upgrading to better armory, building new energy productions, keeping citizens happy, by upgrading technologies, policies, which increase productivity and bring prosperity to your civilisation. As you produce more, you gain more, you buy more and faster, to compete against other civilisations by territorial expansion. There comes a time, when you realise that there’s no more free space to expand on. Then you have to fighting other players. There’s no time to worry about global warming meter. The tension increases because the other player is expanding and growing on an exponential rate. You cannot invest in culture, which generates new more advanced features for your civilisation. You are desperate to build your army, upgrade to planes, then to space rockets, satellites, new science equals new weapons. You look for the weakest player with relatively close distance from you. You start sending spies to trigger mistrust in their cities. Then you spread your religion in their territory, which could even end with a city revolting against its own master. That is when you attack and occupy it for yourself. All that time you never look at the global warming meter, because it’s long term investment, and you need to build up now. But as I was in the year 1930, the meter already reached level 5/7 and the risk of natural disaster has risen 60%. This increases the frequency of disasters on high risk windows, on the map. River floods, rising sea levels, hurricanes, dust storms, blizzards, tornadoes, and droughts damage whatever you have built on the window where they happen. Fixing those windows is expensive and slow, therefore you decide to not rebuild on that land. Instead you attack more cities around you to obtain your opponent’s resources. You build hydro, wind, solar and nuclear energy stations which don’t generate any CO2 in the game, but when it comes to the real world, they only cover 8% of the world’s energy production. The other 92% come from fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. We are not entering some renewable energy era. Political debate is may be moving towards some regulation but the game is not going to stop. The worlds developing civilisations currently produce the most CO2 but looking at the history America and EU is responsible for half of CO2 emitted since 1850s. There’s no interest in slowing down the development because living standards are increasing. There are 195 acclaimed countries trying to compete over finite resources, increasing difficulty of getting them and ever growing complexity of political mechanisms slicing the earth. The vast scale of this world is more than enormous when proportionally weighing it against human lifetime and the capacity of impacts each individual has. As individuals, we are asked to participate in the global modern culture, and seek for pleasures, comforts, that we are so used to. Yet, imagine now populations scrolling through their phones while walking into an alley of catastrophic wipe out of humanity. The underdeveloped parts of the world are exploited and forced to contribute to the growing need of resources for technology production, food production, commodities of modern life, urban and rural infrastructure expansion. Civilisations across the world immeasurably vary in their cultures, traditions, languages, social structures. The blinding arrogance and self-interest of the elite is pushing all of civilisations towards a catastrophic social collapse.

            Global warming6 is too boundless to be completely measured, perceived as one. It's taking place in too many locations at too many points in time. It affects the whole global trading system, political discourses, social behavior and will continue to progress into a new era. Which qualities, values will survive in civilisations around the world will depend on the communities that overcome and adapt to the challenging and changing environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s no surprise that people across the world have concerns for their future. It’s rather shocking how little action we have seen from our governments. Their promises of keeping the average global temperature below 1.5 °C is laughable as they continue investing into fossil fuel industries. The most recent conclusions on the scientific measures reported on COP25 say we are heading to 3 °C warming. At this stage, the governments should be radically reforming policies that govern the industries that pollute, yet they failed to come to a consensus. They debated for two weeks with 500000 protesters outside in the streets of Madrid and not managing to agree on how to regulate carbon budget, postponing the debate to next meeting in 2020. The complexity of this world requires equally complex solutions7, while scientists fear that we have ran out of year already. While governments are winning time to milk this world, scientists are infuriated and hopeless seeing science being not only dismissed but denied8. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is born out of science community in England and is an attempt to put pressure and shift governments to come up with viable solutions. It does so by using contemporary techniques, tactics, mediums, strategies in activism. One of them is the use of modern brand identity. I explore and analyse this field using my graphic design knowledge. The movements greatest challenge is to adapt this identity and yet stay consistent in the message they convey. They do it by graphic visual production on social, news and mass medias, which I examine. I try to construct a useful critique for the brands development.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the very center of these new communities lay the same motives that can be found in social behavior studies of disasters. Scientists are continue making research on how global warming will produce a new era shaped by ever increasing frequencies of disasters and destruction of biosphere. I observed a correlation between communities that rise during disasters and ones starting to take shape in XR movement. The difference is clear in the scale of them as objects. For example 9/11 was a national scale event that as a disaster took place in this one city and involved more countries in the aftermath, but global warming is taking place across the whole planet and involves the sun as a major factor making the scale of the disaster reaching out of the perimeter of the earth. I called it a hyper-disaster in the name of Timothy Morton who named global warming a hyperobject. I then study this disaster and the community that it produced in terms of it being hyper, which makes extinction rebellion a hyper-community as the scale of it extends beyond one place, motive, end goal.

        <h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter2">Rebecca Solnit</a></h3>
        <div class="chapter-body">
          <p>
            Rebecca Solnit in her book A paradise built in hell talks about disasters: events that disrupt societies with a great impact. She takes a step forward and analyses communities that arise from those disasters. She limits herself to right about 5 disasters, which happened in North-America with additional references to the world's famous disasters like Chernobyl, London Blitz, WW2, Vietnam war. She divided her book into chapters according to the events. She always start the chapter by describing what she learned about the disaster. Where, when, how it takes place and then analyses how failing government actions arise from phenomenon called elite panic. In every case she explicitly talks about citizen actions, rise of community, evident altruism, conflicts and longevity of social change. Horrible in itself, disaster is sometimes a door back into paradise, the paradise at least in which we are who we hope to be, do the work we desire, and are each our11 sister’s and brother’s keeper tells Solnit. She looks at the disaster not so much like a journalist but a sociologist. She observes what does the disaster do to the society and it’s citizens (citizens in this context mean people who experience the disaster, not citizens of the nation). While all disasters most definitely do physical destruction to the area in which citizens live, the psychological challenges that arise from that damage are equally explored in this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            She starts the book with a conclusion on what common aspects she observed during her study of disasters The positive emotions that arise in those unpromising circumstances demonstrate that social ties and meaningful work are deeply desired, readily improvised, and intensely rewarding12. Through out the book she continues exploring the joy that people express in the times of despair. It’s controversial to view disasters through a lens of joy, as they are generally represented as negative, fearful, chaotic. The book consists of 5 chapters: 1906 San Fransisco earthquake, 1917 Halifax explosion, 1985 Mexico City earthquake, 2001 New York City 9/11 attacks and 2005 New Orleans storm Katrina. In each chapter she first describes the circumstances in which the disaster took place. This varies a lot with each disaster but she commonly talks about: why the disaster happened; how was the society prepared to handle such event; what did the event look like from ground zero; what happened to the people after the disaster; how authorities reacted; what were the side effects of the disruptions in society? In each chapter she explores a few different topics in order to explain her point, which is that disaster often act as catalyst for communities to rise. It can be hard to comprehend because not many people have experienced a disaster first hand but many have a bias idea what they know from popular culture or mass media. The topics explored in each chapter vary from human psychology, to cinema, other writers who went to see the disasters or representation in mass media and elite panic. These different topics overall are not applicable to each disaster because they’ve happened in different cultural norms at different times, nevertheless the exposed human behavior correlates in each chapter. Solnit does a good job in keeping all of the topics coherent between each chapter.

            The game is designed around civilisations of our real world. It’s depicting the progress of human civilisations: increasing capacities, complexities and modernities.

          </p>
          <p>
            The underlying structure of each chapter is to start with the way this disaster happened, then move to the human condition aspect, specifically how did different classes of society reacted. For each disaster, she introduces witnesses, who expressed their sense of joy, freedom, communal effort. It would be normal to imagine the disaster as a battle ground for survival, filled with suffering. Even though it is hard to grasp how joy exists in the very bottom of disaster, Solnit explicitly highlights that people said they were feeling like living in utopia. The human condition is amplified during such extreme events and the altruism that arises has no boundaries. Each disaster examples of altruism overshadows the selfishness, violence that popular culture has constructed over decades of movies, TV series, books, theater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social change is at the very core of this book. Rebecca describes When we talk of social change, we talk of movements, a word that suggests vast groups of people walking together, leaving behind one way and traveling towards another19 She continues to describe it as it’s the process out of which communities arise. This process is rather bittersweet during disasters as many people die and each death is a tragedy. But to deal with those tragedies you seek for social bonds, support. At the same time when the complexity of the problem is so incredibly large, citizens forget the small issues they had prior to the event. She refers to how everyone is busy and involved in living their lives, going to work, family, friends, all the bubbles society creates. When the disaster happens, capitalism, economics are replaced with moral obligations to care for one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, the system breaks down. Prior to the disaster, all your time and space was occupied by that system. During a disaster, such space and time becomes available for an alternative to emerge. It rather becomes a void and there’s a great need to fulfill it with shared purpose. It’s suspended from everyday concern. You give your attention to other people who you’re surrounded with. The social status, money, material possessions all vanish. Some lose all their belongings, other stay safe. This situation forces people to feel empathy for those who they can help. Having to be in that same environment of loss forms mutual relations. Suddenly, the neighbor who was a stranger to you is in vulnerable position. In that case you are left with an option to ignore and move forward,
            or think what would you like the neighbor to do,
            if you were in his shoes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of a disaster, community is a natural outcome as collaboration brings more benefits than being selfish. Citizens of disaster seek for a shared goal. Communities often form in shared spaces. In the aftermath of a disaster it's could be pop-up kitchens, shelters, open spaces like parks, squares, people's homes, restaurants, refugee camps. Those spaces always plays a crucial role as the people form bonds there. The disaster is an event of great destruction that produces a lot of trash, dirt, things that fall on the ground. That same destruction of architecture is the new space to contemplate over existential thoughts and ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the towers collapsed, people from Manhattan walked over the Williamsburg Bridge to Brooklyn. After such extreme shock to the whole society, those who walked across the bridge had to think what can be done to now, how to continue living life or what to do next. People walked in calmness to Brooklyn. There they were met with gifts from strangers, like beer, water, food. Everyone just stood in streets and talked, while drinking beers, contemplating over life, and the future of this world. You could talk to a stranger, anyone was open to receive you, accept you as you are. There was no hysteria, no panic. It was strange nevertheless joyful, peaceful24. The empathy was in the air, people had time to look at one another, to feel and connect to this space. How Rebecca puts it in her book It’s like a near death experience but lived collectively 25. But then you come back home, turn on your TV, look at the horrifying image on every channel over and over again, but you know it’s not what happened. The reality was that, yes, more than 3000 people died, but the altruism, trust, connection and contemplation for life it produced was for a way greater number of people who lived through this event. The genuine human nature takes people by surprise, especially when you take NYC as an example. The rush city, working day and night. Everyone runs to work, runs back from work and this takes all your life: stress, fatigue, competition, aggression, grim faces. After the attacks, for one week NYC had time to talk, listen to strangers in the street. It was odd, yet everyone had so much joy from the conversations with strangers.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most important aspects of disaster is governments reaction. The government often consists of elite class. Often it’s them who least experience the disaster first hand as their power makes them invincible to the destruction that happens. Elite is more free to move or have a better preparation prior to the disaster. Also, often elite is made of people who are selfish and profit driven actors. Their position often relies on  strategy rather than improvisation. Elite is a word describing power of influence. Solnit uses disaster sociologist Kathleen Tierney to depict what exactly is elite panic …fear of social disorder; fear of poor, minorities and immigrants; obsession with looting and property crime; willingness to resort to deadly force; and actions taken on the basis of rumour26 Solnit continues to describe Elite panic as an attempt to …prevent something that may have only existed in their imaginations.29 A self fulfilling prophecy that is reinforced by the media coverage of how well the authority and establishment is dealing with the chaos. The disaster is often addressed by showing military intervention, the power of the nation, the most brutal way to organise society back into obeying structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the aftermath of disasters, the elites in power panic and perceive all the people as potential treat. But what they fear is not the actual people or victims of the disaster but how Lee Clarke puts it What elites will panic about is the possibility that people will panic30. The procedure of how governments function in times of societal shock can be reduced to an attempt to minimise the risk of an outburst, when in the site of disaster people are in their most vulnerable position and least they want is to have more chaos. This is the exact case for what happened in New Orleans in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina. While Solnit went to study the social aspects of recovery in New Orleans and found amazing evidence for human altruism, Spike Lee covered the scenes of the disaster and its citizens with a documentary called When the levee’s broke. It starts with how media already 2-3 days prior to the hurricane hitting New Orleans announced the threat that this hurricane carries. It clearly depicts what the authorities knew and how much they acted before it hit the city. This movie accurately depicts oppression of black communities in terms of how white republican government only made the aftermath worse for the victims of the hurricane. The whole city was militarised and people were left isolated without any aid or food supplies for almost a week. 85% of the city was under water, with some and mostly poorer neighborhoods sitting 2-4 meters deep. All electricity and irrigation systems were shut off. The official authorities decided to use Superdome, Convention Centre and a hotel next to them as shelters for citizens of the disaster. Those areas were surrounded by water also the roads to them. There were many children and elderly people who had no one to guide or help them. When trying to articulate the situation in New Orleans Solnit puts it this way Fed by racism and the enormity of the storm, the elite panic31 reached extraordinary levels in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina32, …perhaps the worst case of elite panic in the history of United States33.
          </p>
          <p>
            Particularly in New Orleans the rumors like armed gangs raping 7 year old girls in Convention Centre24 were spread by mass media, which created immense hysteria. None of the rumors were found true later on. The police was allowing to shoot any looters so due to hysteria on the news the civilians in white neighborhoods barricaded and started shooting at any black person, who passed by trying to leave the city and carried stuff with them35. None of the rumors were found real, nor the shooters got convicted of any murders.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was enforced by the racism that existed prior to Katrina. But the truth was that gangster in Superdome and Convention Centre did go looting but brought whatever food, water, cloths, whatever they could find, back to the stranded areas and shared with whoever needed them. They did carry guns but were protecting women, children and elderly people, because there were rumors of rape in these places. The nurse interviewed by Spike Lee recalls We were trapped like animals, but I saw the greatest humanity I’d ever seen from the most unlikely places36. One side was oppressed by the other side being the oppressor. Elite panic segregates society based on a bias threat. Elite panic in New Orleans was this devastating because of racism that existed prior to the disaster. For the same reasons rescue missions lagged and most of the deaths happened days after the hurricane in stranded areas. This is more than evident in Spike Lee's documentary, still I fail to comprehend how can the government act that apathetically, and even call their own citizens refugees37 as they were mostly black.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebecca does mention global warming as one of the reasons for writing this book. To her it's the upcoming disaster, so now is the time to learn what will it bring, what ways, and were are the most challenging areas in the times of despair. She's being an optimist in the book, portraying the communities as destined to be together in the hardest times. She's romanticising the feeling of temporality that brings temporal joy, freedom, sense of oneness. She has never lived in a disaster, but calls it a temporary utopia. She writes how societies were temporarily liberated from capitalism slavery, or even started a revolution as the totalitarian government's incompetence and corruption was revealed in the 1985 Mexico city Earth Quake, by poor construction standards that were the reason of why those citizens lost their homes, families and jobs. She's aware of the hardship people experience as she visits New Orleans in the aftermath. Still, her view on global warming is limited to seeing it as series of disasters, not as one entity, not as the result of all earths biosphere, sun's energy and human industrial activity inter-reacting with one another. I see her observations of altruism as activism, activating people's imagination to see beyond the fear the devastating news will bring. It's a beautiful vision for the whole world if you apply her findings to the disasters that are already happening, although I fail to grasp the realness of it, cause it sounds proper on the paper, but looks horrific in an image. I catch myself contemplating in temporality about the city my family, friends live in, the city I grew up in, and how will we all find joy in the mids of the disaster here. I fail to see to that vision as joyful, but not contrary, I see it as liberating from everydayness, from rush, from building up your life with useless wishful thinking. This way global warming is not going to be a disaster.

            <p>
              By analysing R. Solnit's research I learned that disasters are shocks to society, that stop everyday life, destroy large amounts of architecture in a specific area, cause disruption in the economy, political and social systems. It is important for me to distinguish how global warming is not the same, therefore I synthesis what disasters are in to the context of Timothy Mortons book Hyperobjects. Global warming is a hyperobject as it is too large of an entity, in relation to human life, to be completely observed. It starts with James Watts inventing and gaining a patent on combustion engine in April 1784. The engine, that was all purpose machine, moving the world to a new horizon, is using carbon fossil fuels. It gets adopted over the next hundred years and that sparked a new era. Industrialisation brought prosperity to all social classes, therefore families started growing, as they could afford better living conditions, better health care. A more democratic ruling system brought safety to society. That is all global warming or how Morton defines it …things that are massively distributed in time and space relative to humans.45. Therefore disasters that arise due to global warming are not simply objects on their own, but they are part of a larger conglomerate entity. Each year there will be hurricanes, floods, droughts, wild fires, extreme precipitations, extreme heats, that can all be accounted to global warming. As the average temperature is increasing the frequency of disasters does as well. But the environmental, weather, and natural disasters are only fraction to the way those disasters will unfold into the systemic collapse. It's a much larger entity than just one disaster happening in one specific place and time. It is not only many disasters in many places and times, but due to the increasing frequency, it extends into economy, social structures, politics both on ideological and jurisdictional levels. Ever growing frequency of extreme conditions will eventually becomes intertwined, outspread and it will be easier to see it as one entity, therefore I call it a hyperdisaster.

              Even though climate scientists coined a term global warming in 1970's, there has been a largely spread and adapted denial campaign across the world to create doubt in the field of climate change science. This was done by oil companies providing academic grants that research the legitimacy of climate science. This way lagging regulations, creating a difficult environment for scientists to reach consensus. By now denial psychology is well documented by a number of scientists working in a field of ecology like Dr. Peter D. Carter with a book Unprecedented Crime: climate change denial and game changers for survival. It's no longer a debate weather climate change is caused by humans. In science communities a consensus on human made climate change exist for the last 30 years. When it comes to societies only a handful of people who read science and want to learn about global warming know and act upon that consensus. Majority of the people ignore warning statements made by scientists. Regions across the world are confronted with record high temperatures. In the last 9 summers 8 were the hottest ever recorded46. It's hard to ignore once you experience something like 46°C in France, 40.7°C in Netherlands, ±42°C in Belgium on that same day, 25th of July 2019. In contrary more northern regions like Baltic's, where I'm from, only celebrate hotter, longer summers. Here nowadays winters turn out a bit less cold and accumulate snow only in later January. It's hard to get concerned in these comforting conditions. Without scientific research people are incapable of seeing the deep ecological shift that's happening. The denial is not that people purposefully search for ways to dismiss science, but it's in searching for justification to continue exploiting this planet on a regular basis. How Jem Bendell puts it The 'striving' is based in a rationale of maintaining self-identities related to espoused values49. It's unwishful to change modern comfort into austerity. Hyperdisaster will place people in austerity like it or not. We already see dramatic increase in food prices. We now even classify society into those who can afford quality food and those who eat fast and unhealthy food. This is the hyperdisaster. At the same time those who do participate on an individual level in reducing their emissions, practicing to live cleaner, more sustainable lives because they are aware of human induced climate change often do it for wrong reasons. An average person like that thinks there's still time to reverse the change that already happened to climate and that we aim to overcome global warming. On the other hand, scientists are less optimistic. By now, if we consider all industries, political structures, human addiction to modern life, technological infrastructure, inequality between developing and first world countries, and look at the way things are progressing, look at all of it adequately, then we must start considering how to adapt to the changing environments and lead societies into an new era, which will challenge human existence. This is well expressed in J. Bendell's research paper Deep Adaptation with which hope poses existential questions to what does it mean to adapt to a complete collapse of the eco-system, biosphere, stable weather cycle.

              The same way I learned the power of destruction that disasters hold, I also learned about the human capacity to adapt and find meaning in one another. Only when one human will be left standing meaning will be lost. Until then no matter how large the disaster, humans will seek for each other. And in the face of this hyperdisaster, I see a community rise, that is an early reaction to global warming. A rather hyper-reaction as it has to stretch outside one country, adapting a movement throughout the different continents, cultures, languages. A movement with a goal to force governments take actions, announce the climate crisis and start a real hyper-reaction across the world advising and resourcing with each other. However, in the face of global warming as hyperdisaster, these attempts will be a failure, but further actions will be taken no matter, what will be the status of the society. People will continue fighting for survival for generation to come, before the last human stands or the first humans who will leave to start a new era on Mars or outer-space.

              The fact that I played a virtual representation of that disaster is another hyper aspect to it. I think it's my first encounter of global warming as a simulation, which wasn't just an illustration but an experience. This gives a good perspective to how exactly society will deal with it. It doesn't represent future predictions for this world but possible strategies for adapting to the changing environments. It's both scary and beautiful. Global warming by itself is horrifying because we already feel it, see it, calculate it, where as the hyperdisaster is not yet feel-able or visible but can be simulated and imagined from a distance with a sense of beauty. Same way Timothy Morton talks about a black hole, one of his hyperobjects, which is so far away that it cannot do damage to us but our observation of it is more than mermerising, scaling this universe into infinity.

              In the end, humans will always find a reason to continue striving for another day. Even if we now attempt to adapt to the new environment (created by global warming), which might turn out to be impossible to live in and extinction will be inevitable, people will stand because they will do it together. Because the meaning of life is at the very core of this question — to survive. Because studying disasters show how the worst conditions, filled with horror and suffering still bring the most meaningful friendships and form bonds, and eventually bring communities together. It's not so much the end goal of those actions, but the existence of actions themselves. The strive for survival begins and ends with a need to be together.
