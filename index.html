						I don’t get easily offended but when I heard the term balkanisation, a derogatory geopolitical term for the
						process of fragmentation or division of a region or state into smaller regions or states that are often
						hostile or uncooperative with one another, I was rather disturbed. The Balkans have had a turbulent history
						of conquest by the Romans, various nomadic
						tribes, the Ottoman Empire and they have always survived. What led to the assumption that they are more
						uncooperative with one another than other European nations? What is this cloak of dishonour covering the
						region? Undoubtedly, there is much to be proud of—but what is it? Food, dances, knowledge or music? All
						regions in the world can boast with something even if it seems strange or even disturbing to foreigners.
