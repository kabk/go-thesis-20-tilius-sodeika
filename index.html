          One day I was updating my computer programs and the MacOS software lagged. I restarted the computer and it would stop loading on the same bar. I knew the computer was almost out of memory space so I suspected it could be a fatal lag. Therefore, I reinstalled the whole computer software.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time in 3 years I had computer full of memory space. This was something to celebrate and since I was at my cousin’s place who just bought a new computer, we wanted to play a multi-player computer game. I suggested Civilisation IV, which is a strategy game based on building and developing civilisations that correla-
  te with the real world history. I searched on web for the newest version called Civilisation IV: Gathering Storm. After a few hours of downloading, I installed it on my computer, then on my cousins computer. We turned it on and watched the introduction of the video. It starts with a group of scientists standing on ice glacier possibly in Antarctic or Arctic, and the narrator's voice speaks Human advancement knows no boundary… Then suddenly a glacier collapses, the ice cracks beneath the scientists feet, opens and they dramatically fall inside as the voice speaks …but this has been without its price. The video is about the different aspects of civilisations and the milestones in human history. This video captured my attention because it presented climate change as a natural part of human evolution. It states that it’s no longer a debate weather human activity is causing global warming.

        The game is designed around civilisations of our real world. It’s depicting the progress of human civilisations: increasing capacities, complexities and modernities. To start, you choose one of the civilisations. It includes many extinct pre-historic civilisations like Aztecs, Mapuche, Zulu, that have different characteristics than the modern ones like Polish, American, Australian. All civilisations start in pre-historic era and progress to industrialisation and modernisation. As we approached industrialisation in early 19th century, the window for global warming meter lights up. It informs that by using more oil, gas, all sorts of energies to power up your civilisation, you increase CO2 emissions. That increases the frequency of storms, tornadoes and floods, that cause civilisations to lose land on which you grow food, build cities, industries, get your precious and luxury resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          We both noticed the global warming meter but the game is designed for you to have too many other things to worry about: spreading of religions, upgrading to better armory, building new energy productions, keeping citizens happy, by upgrading technologies, policies, which increase productivity and bring prosperity to your civilisation. As you produce more, you gain more, you buy more and faster, to compete against other civilisations by territorial expansion. There comes a time, when you realise that there’s no more free space to expand on. Then you have to fighting other players. There’s no time to worry about global warming meter. The tension increases because the other player is expanding and growing on an exponential rate. You cannot invest in culture, which generates new more advanced features for your civilisation. You are desperate to build your army, upgrade to planes, then to space rockets, satellites, new science equals new weapons. You look for the weakest player with relatively close distance from you. You start sending spies to trigger mistrust in their cities. Then you spread your religion in their territory, which could even end with a city revolting against its own master. That is when you attack and occupy it for yourself. All that time you never look at the global warming meter, because it’s long term investment, and you need to build up now. But as I was in the year 1930, the meter already reached level 5/7 and the risk of natural disaster has risen 60%. This increases the frequency of disasters on high risk windows, on the map. River floods, rising sea levels, hurricanes, dust storms, blizzards, tornadoes, and droughts damage whatever you have built on the window where they happen. Fixing those windows is expensive and slow, therefore you decide to not rebuild on that land. Instead you attack more cities around you to obtain your opponent’s resources. You build hydro, wind, solar and nuclear energy stations which don’t generate any CO2 in the game, but when it comes to the real world, they only cover 8% of the world’s energy production. The other 92% come from fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. We are not entering some renewable energy era. Political debate is may be moving towards some regulation but the game is not going to stop. The worlds developing civilisations currently produce the most CO2 but looking at the history America and EU is responsible for half of CO2 emitted since 1850s. There’s no interest in slowing down the development because living standards are increasing. There are 195 acclaimed countries trying to compete over finite resources, increasing difficulty of getting them and ever growing complexity of political mechanisms slicing the earth. The vast scale of this world is more than enormous when proportionally weighing it against human lifetime and the capacity of impacts each individual has. As individuals, we are asked to participate in the global modern culture, and seek for pleasures, comforts, that we are so used to. Yet, imagine now populations scrolling through their phones while walking into an alley of catastrophic wipe out of humanity. The underdeveloped parts of the world are exploited and forced to contribute to the growing need of resources for technology production, food production, commodities of modern life, urban and rural infrastructure expansion. Civilisations across the world immeasurably vary in their cultures, traditions, languages, social structures. The blinding arrogance and self-interest of the elite is pushing all of civilisations towards a catastrophic social collapse.

            Global warming6 is too boundless to be completely measured, perceived as one. It's taking place in too many locations at too many points in time. It affects the whole global trading system, political discourses, social behavior and will continue to progress into a new era. Which qualities, values will survive in civilisations around the world will depend on the communities that overcome and adapt to the challenging and changing environments.
          </p>

          It’s no surprise that people across the world have concerns for their future. It’s rather shocking how little action we have seen from our governments. Their promises of keeping the average global temperature below 1.5 °C is laughable as they continue investing into fossil fuel industries. The most recent conclusions on the scientific measures reported on COP25 say we are heading to 3 °C warming. At this stage, the governments should be radically reforming policies that govern the industries that pollute, yet they failed to come to a consensus. They debated for two weeks with 500000 protesters outside in the streets of Madrid and not managing to agree on how to regulate carbon budget, postponing the debate to next meeting in 2020. The complexity of this world requires equally complex solutions7, while scientists fear that we have ran out of year already. While governments are winning time to milk this world, scientists are infuriated and hopeless seeing science being not only dismissed but denied8. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is born out of science community in England and is an attempt to put pressure and shift governments to come up with viable solutions. It does so by using contemporary techniques, tactics, mediums, strategies in activism. One of them is the use of modern brand identity. I explore and analyse this field using my graphic design knowledge. The movements greatest challenge is to adapt this identity and yet stay consistent in the message they convey. They do it by graphic visual production on social, news and mass medias, which I examine. I try to construct a useful critique for the brands development.

          At the very center of these new communities lay the same motives that can be found in social behavior studies of disasters. Scientists are continue making research on how global warming will produce a new era shaped by ever increasing frequencies of disasters and destruction of biosphere. I observed a correlation between communities that rise during disasters and ones starting to take shape in XR movement. The difference is clear in the scale of them as objects. For example 9/11 was a national scale event that as a disaster took place in this one city and involved more countries in the aftermath, but global warming is taking place across the whole planet and involves the sun as a major factor making the scale of the disaster reaching out of the perimeter of the earth. I called it a hyper-disaster in the name of Timothy Morton who named global warming a hyperobject. I then study this disaster and the community that it produced in terms of it being hyper, which makes extinction rebellion a hyper-community as the scale of it extends beyond one place, motive, end goal.
